## :book: Planning

### Diagrams
The system design was planned in two main stages:

* **Database:** modeled in [DrawSQL](https://drawsql.app/) to structure entities, relationships, and keys.  
* **Screen Flow:** designed in Figma to map authentication, product registration, report generation, and sales history.
